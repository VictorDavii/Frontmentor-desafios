## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties 
- Flexbox 


### What I learned

Hello, I already have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, even though I already know something I learned a lot, I see that the organization that the site's challenges provides me will help me at this point that I want to improve.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="box-qrcode">
    <figure class="wrapper-img">
        <img>
    </figure>
</section>
```
I give a lot of importance to semantics, because it is with it that we rank better in Google Search.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

Note: I will keep the note above to learn more about Markdown

### Continued development

I want a lot of things in the technology area, I really like AI, machine learning, Mobile. Who knows how to create a company that automates something useful in people's lives.

### Useful resources
